## Installation

> Steps for installation are taken from the [pydualsense](https://github.com/flok/pydualsense) dependency.

You first need to add a udev rule to let the user access the PS5 controller without requiring root privileges.

```bash
sudo cp 70-ps5-controller.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
```

Then install the ```libhidapi-dev```.

```
sudo apt install libhidapi-dev
```

After that install the package from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pydualsense/).

```bash
pip install pydualsense
```

## Launch

After the package has been built and the controller is connected, launch the node using the following command:

```bash
roslaunch smarc_ds5_ros sam_ds5.launch
```

After launching, the following topics will be available:
```bash
- /sam/core/teleop/enable [std_msgs/Bool] (Publish status of teleop enable)
```
